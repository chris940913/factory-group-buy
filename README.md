Group buying product at Factory price.

FGB

We buy things every now and then, we buy furnitures, clothes and so on. But did you know that almost everything we’ve ever paid for is highly overpriced.

Currently the market goes like this:

Goods are produced by manufacturers, then passed on to agent, wholesaler, retailer and to consumers. 
What happen is that a relatively cheap product is being marked up multiple times by different middle-men that the price ended up being ridiculously high.

Our project FGB is creating an online marketplace similar to Lazada but is designed for manufacturers rather than retailers to sell their products, and will cut off the middle-men allowing consumers to buy directly from the factory.

It’s impossible for a factory to produce only one product for one consumer, because it’s not cost efficient. 
So we offer a group buy function where manufacturers can set a minimum order quantity and only starts production when the target is met.

For example a manufacturer waits until they’ve received 500 confirmed orders, then they start producing and shipping out their products to consumers that’ve placed the order.
